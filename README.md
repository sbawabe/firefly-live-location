## How to run

In order to render the map within the app, you will need to create a `.env` file in the project root directoy, which contains:

```
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN="<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>"
```

You can access your MapBox token by going to [https://console.mapbox.com/](https://console.mapbox.com/) and generating one.

Then, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This will run the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
